# Flower Classification using Deep Learning

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to classify images of flowers into different categories. The model is built using PyTorch and leverages pre-trained models for transfer learning.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to classify flower images into various categories using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Transfer learning is utilized by fine-tuning pre-trained models such as InceptionV3.
